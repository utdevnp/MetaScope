# MetaScope - Analyze and Optimize Meta Tags

**MetaScope** is an intuitive tool for analyzing website meta tags, including SEO, social media, and verification tags. It highlights missing or mismatched tags and presents results in a clean, user-friendly format, making it easy to optimize your site for search engines and social sharing.

## Story Behind the Creation  
I am a web developer who has worked on various types of websites. In the past, one of the crucial tasks I often faced was managing basic SEO implementation in websites. Many times, clients asked me to check the meta tags in their websites (new or existing). Initially, I manually checked each tag line by line in the code, which was tedious and time-consuming. Over time, I realized the need for a tool that could check basic tags all at once. This past experience inspired me to create **MetaScope**, a tool to streamline the process and make meta tag analysis quick and efficient.

## Features  
- Analyze SEO meta tags for completeness and accuracy.  
- Check social media tags (Facebook Open Graph, Twitter Cards, etc.).  
- Identify missing or incorrect verification tags.  
- User-friendly interface with clean and actionable results.
